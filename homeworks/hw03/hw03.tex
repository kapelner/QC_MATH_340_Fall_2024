\begin{abstract}
The path to success in this class is to do many problems. Unlike other courses, exclusively doing reading(s) will not help. Coming to lecture is akin to watching workout videos; thinking about and solving problems on your own is the actual ``working out.''  Feel free to \qu{work out} with others; \textbf{I want you to work on this in groups.}

Reading is still \textit{required}. For this homework set, review Math 241 concerning random variables, support, parameter space, PMF's, the central limit theorem (CLT), variance, covariance.

The problems below are color coded: \ingreen{green} problems are considered \textit{easy} and marked \qu{[easy]}; \inorange{yellow} problems are considered \textit{intermediate} and marked \qu{[harder]}, \inred{red} problems are considered \textit{difficult} and marked \qu{[difficult]} and \inpurple{purple} problems are extra credit. The \textit{easy} problems are intended to be ``giveaways'' if you went to class. Do as much as you can of the others; I expect you to at least attempt the \textit{difficult} problems. \qu{[MA]} are for those registered for 621 and extra credit otherwise.

This homework is worth 100 points but the point distribution will not be determined until after the due date. See syllabus for the policy on late homework.

Up to 5 points are given as a bonus if the homework is typed using \LaTeX. Links to instaling \LaTeX~and program for compiling \LaTeX~is found on the syllabus. You are encouraged to use \url{overleaf.com}. If you are handing in homework this way, read the comments in the code; there are two lines to comment out and you should replace my name with yours and write your section. The easiest way to use overleaf is to copy the raw text from hwxx.tex and preamble.tex into two new overleaf tex files with the same name. If you are asked to make drawings, you can take a picture of your handwritten drawing and insert them as figures or leave space using the \qu{$\backslash$vspace} command and draw them in after printing or attach them stapled.

The document is available with spaces for you to write your answers. If not using \LaTeX, print this document and write in your answers. I do not accept homeworks which are \textit{not} on this printout. Keep this first page printed for your records.

What is the probability the average yearly return over 20yr is positive? Note: this is a different question from \qu{do you make money over 20yr given an initial investment}? We will learn how to answer that latter question later in the semester when we learn about the LogNormal rv.}\spc{4}

\end{enumerate}


\problem{These exercises will introduce the concept of covariance (the metric that gauges linear dependence between two rv's).}

\eeqn

\end{enumerate}

\problem{These questions are about convergence.}

\begin{enumerate}

\intermediatesubproblem{Given

\beqn
X_n \sim \begin{cases}
0 \withprob 1 - \frac{1}{(n+1)^2} \\
1 \withprob \frac{1}{(n+1)^2} \\
\end{cases}
\eeqn

Show that $X_n \convd 0$. To do so, write out the PMF of $X_n$ as a CDF using indicator functions in new format and then take the limit. You can also use the theorem we never proved that $\limitn \indic{a_n} = \indic{\limitn a_n}$. }\spc{5}

\intermediatesubproblem{Prove that $X_n \convp 0$. For a full proof of $\forall \epsilon$, you need to show it for $\epsilon < 1$ and $\epsilon \geq 1$ separately but since we only care about small epsilon, you can just demonstrate it for $\epsilon < 1$.}\spc{7}

\intermediatesubproblem{If $X_n \sim \exponential{n}$, prove that $X_n \convd 0$.}\spc{7}

\intermediatesubproblem{If $X_n \sim \exponential{n}$, prove that $X_n \convp 0$. You can prove this using its CDF, using P7 of chf's or using Markov's inequality.}\spc{7}

\hardsubproblem{[MA] Prove that PDF convergence implies CDF convergence (i.e., that $X_n \convd X$). You will need to use the dominated convergence theorem (DCT). Justifying the use of the DCT is slightly harder.}\spc{7}

\intermediatesubproblem{Let $X_n \sim f_{X_n}(x) = (1 - \cos{2\pi n x}) \indic{x \in \zeroonecl}$. Show that $X_n \convd \stduniform$. Hint: use the fact that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\frac{\sin{nx}}{n} = 0$ which should have been proven using the \qu{squeeze theorem} in your calculus class. The CDF is pictured below for $n = 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$.}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{conv.jpg}
\end{figure}~\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{[MA] Show that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f_{X_n}$ does not exist. This is a counterexample to the conjecture that CDF convergence implies PDF convergence for finite continuous distributions with a limiting continuous distribution. Hint: it is just a calculus exercise.}\spc{2}
